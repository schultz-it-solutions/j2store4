Dear J2Store Community,

After I camee to know that cartrabbit will no longer maintain/develop J2Store, I found myself in a (not at all unknown) unexpected situation.
We are running several J2Store websites, and one in particuar where I did heavily develop additional functionality to integrate J2Store with the other functionality of that website.
So migrating the shop system to another component will be a major headache for me.

Therefore I created this fork for our own purposes - I see there is a number of other forks, and maybe we can join forces to keep this product alive...
kind regards
Ruediger Schultz

**Important Announcement: Sunsetting J2Store Development**

Dear J2Store Community,

We have always strived to deliver quality eCommerce extension through J2Store, and we deeply appreciate the trust and support you have shown us over the years. However, after careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to sunset the development of J2Store and its associated extensions.

This decision has not come easily. The rising costs of development, combined with dwindling revenue, have made it increasingly challenging for us to continue offering the level innovation that you deserve. As a result, we have chosen to sunset  J2Store's development, but keep it as open-source software for you to fork and build upon.

**What this means for you:**
- The J2Store repository has been archived, and the project will no longer be actively maintained.
- All open issues in the repository have been closed.
- J2Store will remain available for the community to explore, fork, and build upon.

**Extensions:**
If you have purchased a license for any paid extensions and have an active license (a license is valid for a year from the date of purchase), you will continue to receive support until your license is valid. You can access support for the extension via our website.

We want to thank everyone who has been a part of the J2Store journey—your feedback, contributions, and enthusiasm have been invaluable.

Thank you for being a part of this journey with us. We hope that by open-sourcing the project, J2Store can continue to live on in new and exciting ways.
